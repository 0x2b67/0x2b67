# Salut / Hey, I'm Arceus! 👋🏻
I am a developer with a focus on backend development, mainly working with JavaScript and Python for my projects.
## About Me 🙋🏻‍♂️
Interested in programming for 4 years now, I launched my first project in 2023.
<br />Currently, I'm working on a few projects which you can find below.
<br />I speak 🇫🇷 🇬🇧 🇪🇸, and I like music! 🎶
## Check out my projects 🚀
- I own [Daily Music](https://daily-music.xyz), a Discord app offering songs recommendations, challenges, and events to keep your community engaged.
- I own [My UFC](https://top.gg/bot/1247269790993879200/), a Discord app notifying users when a UFC event is starting.
