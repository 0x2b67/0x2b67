# Salut / Hey! 👋🏻 I'm Arceus.
I'm a developer with a focus on [backend development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend), mainly working with [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) for my projects.
<br />Most of my repositories are private, but if you're interested you'll find a list of my projects below! ⬇️
## About Me 📒
I began coding in 2020, but I really started in the summer of 2023.
<br />Since then, I've dedicated a lot of time to building my own Discord app, [Daily Music](https://daily-music.xyz).
<br />I'm fluent in both 🇫🇷 and 🇬🇧, and I also speak some 🇪🇸.
## My Projects 🔥
- I own [Daily Music](https://daily-music.xyz), a Discord app offering songs recommendations, challenges, and events to keep your community engaged.
- I own [My UFC](https://top.gg/bot/1247269790993879200/), a Discord app notifying users when a UFC event is starting.
- I'm helping in the development (beta-testing) of the new version of [Discord.Watch](https://discord.watch), a ranking website for Discord apps with stats.
- I'm conducting scam investings for [The DSP Project](https://dsp-project.glitch.me/), a project aiming to clean Discord of scams and other dangers.
