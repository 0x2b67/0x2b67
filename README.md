<h2 align="left">About Me  📝
</h2>
<p align="left">I started writing my first lines of code in 2020, but I've only really started getting interested since the summer of 2023.
  <br>I mainly use JavaScript and Python, but I also have some knowledge of C.
  <br>Since the summer of 2023, I've been spending a lot of time coding my own Discord bot, 
  <a href="https://daily-music.xyz">Daily Music.
  </a>
  <br>I speak both 🇫🇷 and 🇬🇧 fluently, and also some 🇪🇸
